![PEP8 schedule](static/images/testing/testingschedule-pep8.png)  

All Python files were entered into the PEP8 online checker to find if it contained any errors. In some cases there were errors notified which was duly corrected.  A few errors were raised in the settings file, however these were default django authorisation code and could not be changed to remove the errors.

Individual screenshots for the PEP8 Validators can be found below:
