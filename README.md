# Clean Eats Kitchen

Hello! This is my Fourth Project with the Code Institute and I have created a food recipe site called Clean Eats Kitchen. It has been built in Django using Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTML, and enables users to create and share healthy recipes with other users around the world. It has been targeted towards people who want to eat healthy while allowing the meals to have a 'cheat' feel. Users are able to create their own accounts in order to share their own recipes. They can also comment and like recipes. 

This site has been centred around a centric database and allows full CRUD functionality. The site also ensures role based permissions to seperate user functionality and restrict certain content.

### Wireframes
To create my wireframes I used Balsamiq, which is a free to use wireframe software. I wanted to created my basic wireframes for the three main screen widths such as Desktop, Tablet and Mobile. In order to help my design thinking process I created the 4 main pages for mty site so I can follow a similar style for my other smaller pages. Please follow the links below to view each wireframe individually.
