# Clean Eats Kitchen

Hello! This is my Fourth Project with the Code Institute and I have created a food recipe site called Clean Eats Kitchen. It has been built in Django using Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTML, and enables users to create and share healthy recipes with other users around the world. It has been targeted towards people who want to eat healthy while allowing the meals to have a 'cheat' feel. Users are able to create their own accounts in order to share their own recipes. They can also comment and like recipes. 

This site has been centred around a centric database and allows full CRUD functionality. The site also ensures role based permissions to seperate user functionality and restrict certain content.

### Wireframes
To create my wireframes I used Balsamiq, which is a free to use wireframe software. I wanted to created my basic wireframes for the three main screen widths such as Desktop, Tablet and Mobile. In order to help my design thinking process I created the 4 main pages for mty site so I can follow a similar style for my other smaller pages. Please follow the links below to view each wireframe individually.

#### Index page:

* [Index page desktop wireframe](/assets/wireframes/desktop-index.png)
* [Index page tablet wireframe](/assets/wireframes/tablet-index.png)
* [Index page mobile wireframe](/assets/wireframes/recipe-detail-mobile.png)

My index page aims to capture the users by being visually attractive and have a clear structure. My index page aims to be simple in layout with clear indication of what time site aim is. 

#### Recipes Page:

* [Recipe page desktop wireframe](assets/wireframes/desktop-recipes-overview.png)
* [Recipe tablet desktop wireframe](assets/wireframes/tablet-recipes-overview.png)
* [Recipe mobile desktop wireframe](assets/wireframes/mobile-recipe-overview.png)

My recipes page section should be clearly structured in meal time oder (Breakfast, dinner, tea, treats). This should allow ease of navigation and should help users narrow their search field without needing the known the exact recipe they are after. This page should be again visually beautiful through colours and animations. 

#### Recipe instructions:

* [Individual recipe instructions page desktop wireframe](assets/wireframes/desktop-recipes-steps.png)
* [Individual recipe instructions page tablet wireframe](assets/wireframes/tablet-recipe-steps.png)
* [Individual recipe instructions page mobile wireframe](assets/wireframes/mobile-recipe-steps.png)

The recipe instructions should be again simple in design and well structured. This should include unordered bullet points for the ingredients and numbered bullet points for the instructions so user can clearly distinguish each section. Information on this page needs to be clear and concise for readability. 
#### Profile Page:

* [Profile page desktop wireframe](assets/wireframes/desktop-profilepage.png)
* [Profile page tablet wireframe](assets/wireframes/tablet-profilepage.png)
* [Profile page mobile wireframe](assets/wireframes/mobile-profilepage.png)

The profile page aims to be a hub where users can edit and delete their wn profiles. This should act as a page where they can easily navigate to previous recipes they have liked and their own recipes they have added to the website.

#### Technologies Used

* HTML
    * HTML was used as the base language for the templates created for the site.

* CSS
    * Custom css style was used to create my own look and presentation of the site to avoid the site looking to much like a bootstrap site.

* Bootstrap 5.13
    * Bootstrap was used for general layout and ease of create elements within the site with its predefined templates.

* Jinja/Django Templating
    * Jinja/Django templating language was utilised to create HTML, XML or other markup formats that are returned to the user via an HTTP response

* JavaScript
    * To create custom functionality and create resposive elements and interfaces for the user

* Python
    
* Django
    * Python Framework
    * Django AllAuth 

* Heroku
    * Was used as the cloud based platform to deploy the site.

* Heroku PostgreSQL
    * Heroku PostgreSQL was used as the database for this project during development and in production.
